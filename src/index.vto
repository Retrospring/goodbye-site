  Retrospring is no longer available as of September 1st, 2025
</h1>

<div class="bg-white rounded-md shadow-lg p-3 text-center mb-3">
  <p>
    Retrospring has been permanently shut down. As of this date, the site and
    all of its functionality are no longer accessible.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unfortunately, data export is no longer possible. All user data is scheduled
    for permanent deletion around the time of shutdown, in line with our
    original plans and privacy commitments.

<h2 class="text-4xl text-center mb-3 !mt-5">General Information</h2>
<div class="bg-white rounded-md shadow-lg p-3 text-center mb-3">
  <h3 class="mb-0">Archived Content</h3>
  <p>
    We teamed up with ArchiveTeam to preserve all publicly accessible
    Retrospring content before the shutdown. With this static page now live,
    most URLs to profiles, questions and answers will automatically redirect to
    their archived versions on the Wayback Machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    While not everything will work exactly as it did, this should keep a good
    chunk of old links at least partially functional for the foreseeable future.

    Our social media accounts on X (formerly Twitter) <a

    >@retrospring</a>, Bluesky <a

    >@retrospring@floss.social</a> will remain online, but they wonâ€™t be
    actively monitored.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're keeping these accounts around mainly to prevent misuse of the
    Retrospring name and to post updates if anything concerning comes up.

  <h3 class="mb-0">Source Code</h3>
  <p>
    Retrospring has been open source since 2015, and the code will remain
    available for anyone interested.
  </p>
  <p>
    However, with the shutdown on September 1st, 2025, active development and
    support have officially ended. All repositories will be archived in a
    read-only state.

  <h3 class="mb-0">Contributors</h3>
  <p>
    Retrospring wouldnâ€™t have been what it was without the many people who
    helped shape it over the years. Whether you contributed code, submitted bug
    reports, translated the interface, suggested features, or simply recommended
    the site to a friend â€” thank you.
  </p>
  <p>
    This was always a community-driven project, and every bit of feedback,
    support, and enthusiasm meant the world to us. You helped make Retrospring
    better, kinder, and more fun for everyone. ðŸ’™

  <h3 class="mb-0">Supporters</h3>
  <p>
    Thank you to everyone who supported Retrospring through Patreon, GitHub
    Sponsors, and OpenCollective. With your help, we raised around $450 in
    donations, which ended up mostly being unused.
  </p>
  <p>
    These have been split equally and donated to three non-profit organizations
    we care about: Queer Lexikon, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), and
    Humedica â€” $150 each.
